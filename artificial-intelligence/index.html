    <p data-en="Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the big elephant in the room that everyone's talking about but nobody can agree on. AGI would be AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence across virtually all domains—not just playing chess or generating text, but reasoning, learning, creating, and adapting like humans do, just potentially much faster and with perfect memory. Some experts think we'll get there by 2030, others say 2050, and some think it might never happen. The crazy part? Even the experts who are building these systems can't agree, which tells you just how unprecedented this territory is."
